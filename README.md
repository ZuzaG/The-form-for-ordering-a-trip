# The form for ordering a trip

The tool is used to order tours by uploading a CSV file. After loading the file (the sample file is in the repository), the tours that can be selected appear in the main part. After selecting the option that interests us, the side panel shows a summary of the selection made with the option of deleting any item. Then, after providing the appropriate data, we will receive a message confirming the order.

**The purpose of the project**:
The aim of the project was to practice using forms. The project also uses loops, arrays, functions, DOM, including cloning.
